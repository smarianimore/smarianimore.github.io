## Overview

If you like **programming**, **data analysis**, **machine learning**, tinkering with **Internet of Things** devices, or mess around with **networked computers**, you're in the right place :)

Here below I keep track of available thesis and internships, as well as past ones (to help you get an idea of what to expect based on what your colleagues did in the past).
While scrolling through the proposals, keep in mind that **most internships may become thesis and most thesis can scale down to an internship**, hence if you find something interesting but in the "wrong" category, *do not lose hope*: [contact me](mailto:stefano.mariani@unimore.it) and we'll manage to adapt the proposal to your needs!

Also, proposals are roughly divided in categories, representing the research topic they are meant to deal with: if you find an appealing topic, but not a satisfactory proposal therein, [contact me](mailto:stefano.mariani@unimore.it) and we'll discuss your own proposals :)

Finally, if you have **your own proposal** for a thesis or an internship [contact me](mailto:stefano.mariani@unimore.it), *even if not covering the topics below*, and we'll discuss.

## Causal reasoning, Bayesian and reinforcement learning in multiagent systems and IoT

Various forms of learning are used in multiagent systems (MAS) to let agents *individually* learn to accomplish a task, or to recognise a given state of the world.
Instead, letting agents *learn how to interact socially* is yet underexplored in scientific literature, but a promising topic to let multiagent systems self-organise to achieve a shared or system goal.
The following activities unfold within this theme.

### Thesis

 - apply either form of learning ([reinforcement](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-reinforcement-learning-588c071af1ec), [structural bayesian](https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/aimagazine/article/view/918), [causal](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Papers/intro_gm.pdf)) to let agents in a MAS, or devices in a Internet of Things (IoT) deployment, learn from scratch known interaction protocols (e.g. [FIPA protocols](http://www.fipa.org/repository/ips.php3))
 - given a pre-built Bayesian network, or causal structural model, let agents interact according to it to accomplish given goals (e.g. in a IoT scenario of choice). *Optionally*, let agents explain their course of actions by using the model (Bayesian or causal) as [argumentation graph](http://www.cs.uu.nl/docs/vakken/mcarg/)
 - based on open datasets to be found on the web (e.g. assisted living or smart homes domain, [this](https://lig-getalp.imag.fr/fr/health-smart-home-his-datasets/) or [that](https://project.inria.fr/toyotasmarthome/)), implement causal discovery algorithms from the scientific literature and test them on such data (e.g. [this one](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9196246)

### Internships
