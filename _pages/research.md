My research activity revolves around two prominent themes: how to best **coordinate** an ensamble of digital entities towards a systemic goal, and how to provide **"intelligent" support** to human activities through digital tools.

As such, I'm doing (or did) research activities in the following fields:
 - coordination models, languages, and technologies for multi-agent systems
 - agent-oriented models, languages, and technologies
 - self-organising mechanisms and systems
 - socio-cognitive models of behaviour and interaction to enhance coordination mechanisms
 - logic programming as a form of "Edge intelligence"
 - blockchain technologies and smart contracts for distributed and decentralised coordination
 - application of the above to pervasive systems such as the Internet of Things
 - application of the above to socio-technical systems such as information systems
 - decision support systems for patient empowerment in healthcare applications
 - decision support systems for clinical practice in healthcare applications


## Coordination in socio-technical systems

**Problem**: *Socio-technical systems*[^1] cannot be coordinated with the same mechanisms and techniques used for purely technical systems.

**Solution**: Consider *socio-cognitive* theories of action and interaction while designing such coordination mechanisms and techniques.

**Goal**: *Improve* system coordination outcomes, however defined on a functional or non-functional perspective.

**Methods**: Exploit humans social interactions and cognitive stance to *adapt* system behaviour.
