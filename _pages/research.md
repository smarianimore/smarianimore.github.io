## Overview

My research activity revolves around two prominent themes: how to best **coordinate** an ensamble of digital entities towards a systemic goal, and how to provide **"intelligent" support** to human activities through digital tools.

As such, I'm doing (or did) research activities in the following fields:
 - coordination models, languages, and technologies for multi-agent systems
 - agent-oriented models, languages, and technologies
 - self-organising mechanisms and systems
 - socio-cognitive models of behaviour and interaction to enhance coordination mechanisms
 - logic programming as a form of "Edge intelligence"
 - blockchain technologies and smart contracts for distributed and decentralised coordination
 - application of the above to pervasive systems such as the Internet of Things
 - application of the above to socio-technical systems such as information systems
 - decision support systems for patient empowerment in healthcare applications
 - decision support systems for clinical practice in healthcare applications


## Coordination in socio-technical systems

**Problem**: *Socio-technical systems*[^1] cannot be coordinated with the same mechanisms and techniques used for purely technical systems.

**Solution**: Consider *socio-cognitive* theories of action and interaction while designing such coordination mechanisms and techniques.

**Goal**: *Improve* system coordination outcomes, however defined on a functional or non-functional perspective.

**Methods**: Exploit humans social interactions and cognitive stance to *adapt* system behaviour.

[^1]: According to my own interpretation, briefly: *systems featuring "humans-in-the-loop" which are not merely users but actively contribute in the system's own functioning*.

## Coordination in pervasive systems

  <figcaption>New abstraction layers and rich forms of interaction are needed to cope with IoT scenarios increasing complexity.</figcaption>
</figure>

**Problem**: Coordination in pervasive systems cannot be done by individually and imperatively programming each partecipating device: the levels of *abstraction* and *autonomy* are too low.

**Solution**: Consider ways to let devices figure out how to participate to a systemic *goal* given by designer or arising dynamically according to *context*.

**Goal**: Increase system's *robustness* through device and system autonomy.

**Methods**: Endow devices with *learning* capabilities and *goal-oriented* behaviour, and the system with rich forms of interaction (e.g. *argumentation*).

## Decision support systems in healthcare

</figure>

**Problem**: Designing decision support systems for the healthcare domain is difficult for many reasons, amongst which
 1. support *portability* of the machine learning *pipeline*
 2. optimise the trade-off between well-assessed *best practices* and *patient-specific data*
 3. guarantee *interpretable* suggestions.

**Solution**: Respectively
 1. rely on well-assessed *software engineering* principles
 2. design a coherent conceptual and technological framework for the broad domain of so-called *cognitive systems*
 3. adopt transparent and *explainable* algorithms.

**Goal**: Extend *adoption* and improve *performance* of decision support systems in healthcare

**Methods**: Again, respectively
 1. rely on *standards* such as [PFA](http://dmg.org/pfa/) for machine learning pipelines representation and sharing and prefer *web* technologies for deployment
 2. integrate the *BDI* agent architecture with *machine learning* methods
 3. prefer explainable algorithms or adopt *argumentation*
