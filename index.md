Welcome :)

I'm Stefano Mariani, **tenure-track** researcher ("RTD-b") in the [Distributed and Pervasive Intelligence Group](http://dipi.unimore.it) at the [**Department of Sciences and Methods for Engineering**](https://www.dismi.unimore.it/site/en/home.html) of the **University of Modena and Reggio Emilia**, Italy.
On my spare time (lol) I enjoy music, basketball, and being a father of three---although as females they often prefer fairies and makeup to dinosaurs and robots...oh well.

Now, back to business.

## Current position

Tenure-track researcher at the Department of Sciences and Methods for Engineering of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy ("RTD-b", in Italian)

## Current research

PI for the FAR project ["CO-OPTION"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10MdOD4w54qyMoiC_LwIMXYGvQGu9KG1I/view?usp=sharing). 

The project aims to address **human cooperation in the sustainable management of public goods**, examining how institutional punishments and corruption affect collaboration. Using an approach that combines behavioural economics, game theory, and artificial intelligence, the project studies complex scenarios to improve policies and governance models. The results could be applied to areas such as natural resource management and labour market regulation.
