I'm happy to share that I won my very first competitive application for funding: the **CO-OPTION** project proposal has been awarded funding by the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia :)

The project aims to address human **cooperation** in the **sustainable management of public goods**, 
examining how institutional punishments and corruption affect collaboration. 
Using an approach that combines **behavioural economics**, **game theory**, and **artificial intelligence**, 
the project studies complex scenarios to improve policies and governance models. 
The results could be applied to areas such as natural resource management and labour market
regulation.

My Italian speaking friends can read more in the dedicated issue of [FocusUnimore](https://www.focus.unimore.it/meccanismi-della-cooperazione-comparazione-interlinguistica-e-immagini-generate-dallai-sono-i-temi-dei-progetti-finanziati-dalla-linea-unimore-reggio/) :)

*I didn't conceive the project proposal all by myself*: without the collaboration with Prof. [Francesca Pancotto](https://sites.google.com/view/francescapancotto) and Prof. [Simone Righi](https://www.simonerighi.com/) CO-OPTION wouldn't even exist!
Thanks to them, and to Prof. [Barbara Luppi](https://personale.unimore.it/rubrica/dettaglio/bluppi) and [Fabio D'Andreagiovanni](https://personale.unimore.it/rubrica/dettaglio/fdandrea) for joining the team :)

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:stefano.mariani@unimore.it) to know how you can join us!

Peace.
