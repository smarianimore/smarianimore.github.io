I'm proud to announce that we won the **best paper award** at [IDC 2021](http://www.idc2021.unirc.it), ex-aequo with colleagues from Saint Petersburg State University :)

Kudos to [Marco Gambelli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-gambelli-a7690020b), the brilliant master student who did most of the practical work of developing the simulations and analysing the results!

In brief, the paper studies the opportunity of *progressively* deploying a *combination* of different *crossing strategies* to different portions of an *intersection network*.
The study is motivated by the fact that, in a future of connected and self-driving vehicles, it is unrealistic to think that city administrators will replace all the existing road infrastructures *at once*, suddenly enabling advanced intersection crossing strategies anywhere.
Rather, it is more realistic to think in terms of a progressive replacement, possibly focussing first on the those intersections in a network that would benefit the most from advanced coordination strategies.

The key results achieved are:
  - **reservation-based** strategies, beside performing better than other strategies at the level of individual intersections (as already known from the literature), have the **best global impact** on the intersections network
  - even in the case where only a **few intersections** are managed through reservation, **significant global improvements** to the traffic situation are still observed
  - not only the **number**, but also the **locations** where reservation-based strategies are deployed has an impact

The plot below (Figure 3 in the paper) demonstrates the best combination and displacement of crossing strategies in the considered intersections network.

Instead, the plot below (Figure 5 in the paper) demonstrates the effect of progressive deployment.

As soon as the paper actually becomes available online, I'll post it in the [Publications]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/pubs) section, hence remember to keep an eye on it if interested in the topic ;)
Or, [contact me](mailto:stefano.mariani@unimore.it) for a pre-print or any further inquiry :)

Peace.
