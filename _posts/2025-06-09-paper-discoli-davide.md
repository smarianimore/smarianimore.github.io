Dear fellow researchers, [DISCOLI'25 just concluded](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/claudio-savaglio-93870063_lucca-discoli-dcoss-activity-7339969773104943104-5xF0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAzy1fUBs7hKcdd5DFPhk8ePf5E0KdYraAQ), and it was a very special event to attend for at least one person: [Davide Borghi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davide-borghi-72ba81190/), who presented his very first scientific paper :)

Davide is a research fellow at the [Institute of Informatics and Telematics](https://www.iit.cnr.it/en/about-us/) of the National Research Council that collaborates with me and [Franco Zambonelli](http://www.agentgroup.unimore.it/Zambonelli/) on **learning communication policies in artificial swarms**.

His work -- slides are freely available [here](https://shorturl.at/th6xl), proceedings are in press -- advances a previous work by me and Franco ([here](https://smarianimore.github.io/2023/09/19/paper-acsos2023.html)) that investigated whether and how individuals in a **swarm** can **learn communication policies** to achieve a goal requiring **collective intelligence**.

While we proved that such communication policies can be learnt and that the learnt policies are also more efficient than hard-coded ones, 
Davide further advanced by proving that individuals can learn to exploit the **same communication signal for different purposes**, 
even in mixed populations!

This means that the learning process and the convergence policies are **robust to the noise** generated by heterogeneous agents in the population.

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:stefano.mariani@unimore.it) for a pre-print, any inquiry, or even better **to join us** in this research :)

Peace.
