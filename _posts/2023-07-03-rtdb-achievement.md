I started today (July 1st, officially) my new research contract as "Ricercatore a Tempo Determinato lettera b)", 
that can be roughly translated to "fixed term post-doc researcher".

It doesn' t seem quite an achievement, but actually it is, at least for me: 
**in three years, I will become associate professor** 🍾
(unless I make someone angry or if I suddenly stop publishing or die 😅)

This means essentially two things to me, personally:
  * no more "publish or perish" anxiety (perhaps no more "[impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)"? would be wonderful...)
  * financial stability for my family (👨🏻‍👩🏻‍👧🏻‍👦🏻 + 1 😅)

**I owe this achievement to a many people**. 
I'll try my best to be concise but exhaustive.

To my most recent supervisor, Prof. **Franco Zambonelli**, 
that more than anyone else helped me focus and persist, 
from whom I learnt too many things to be listed here, 
and who layed before me the path toward this achievement in the best way possible.

To my PhD supervisor, Prof. **Andrea Omicini**, 
that made me fall in love with this sometimes weird job of "doing research", 
and kick-started my early research days with unmatched patience.

To Prof. **Alessandro Ricci**, 
that I look to as a role model for his unmatched passion 
and unlimited curiosity.

To Prof. **Mirko Viroli**, 
that I look to as a role model of scientific discipline 
and teaching skills.

  To my colleague Dott. **Marco Picone** 
for sharing with me his passion about Digital Twins 
and his unmatched networking skills.
  To my colleague Prof. **Sara Montagna** 
for sharing with me her passion about applied research 
and her family stories.
  To my colleague Dott. **Danilo Pianini** 
that I look to as a role model of dedication 
and scientific rigour.
  To my colleague Dott. **Giovanni Ciatto** 
for his patience and desire for learning. 
  To my colleague Dott. **Roberta Calegari** 
for making feel like a knew what I was doing. 
  To Prof. **Michela Milano** 
for sharing with me her appreciation during my early career, 
that still helps me when the impostor syndrome kicks in.

I am and will be always grateful to you all.
