Ladies and gentlemen, in a few hours a brilliant PhD student, [Giovanni Briglia](https://giovannibriglia.github.io/), will be presenting a paper at an international conference for his very first time! 

He will be presenting a paper co-authored by myself, [Marco Lippi](https://ai.dinfo.unifi.it/people/lippi/), and [Franco Zambonelli](http://www.agentgroup.unimore.it/Zambonelli) about **improving Reinforcement Learning with Causal Reasoning**!

**The warmest congratulations to Giovanni, bravo!**

In brief, the paper proposes an architecture and method to **augment an RL algorithm with a causal discovery and inference** module: 
the former enables the agent to **learn the cause-effect** relationships between state variables of the environment, its own actions, and the expected reward, 
whereas the latter enables exploiting such knowledge to perform **prediction** of action effects and **planning** of actions to reach states.

The key results achieved are:
  - the RL algorithms augmented with this causal machinery are *more efficient during exploration*
  - they also converge to *more efficient policies*
  - the learnt causal model enables *better generalisation* to unseen environments
