I'm glad to announce that also this year[^1] I am amongst the organisers of the [Agents Applied to Healthcare (A2HC) workshop](https://a2hc2021.github.io), part of [AAMAS international conference](https://aamas2021.soton.ac.uk).

Check out the website as submission dates have just been published (spoiler: **February 5th**).

Don't miss this opportunity to present, discuss, and publish your research work on **agent models and technologies applied to the healthcare domain!**

Peace.

[^1]: last year edition, again with AAMAS, was named ["Healthcare Intelligent Multiagent Systems" (HIMAS)](http://apice.unibo.it/xwiki/bin/view/HIMAS2020/WebHome).
