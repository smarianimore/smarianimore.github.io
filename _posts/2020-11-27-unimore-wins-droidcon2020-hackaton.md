I'm happy to announce that me and [Marco Picone](https://marcopicone.net) from UniMore won the [DroidCon2020 MEC hackaton](https://it.droidcon.com/2020/hackathon/)!

Our project on **Cognitive Mobility** exploiting **5G MEC architecture** to deliver *low-latency location-based* event notifications about traffic, congestion forecast, and mobility patterns has been awarded by the international jury with the 1st place :)

As a part of our final software prototype, we also released the **Openness Connector java library** on [Github](https://github.com/openness-4-java) to ease the life of developers willing to interact with the MEC API provided by the [Openness platform](https://www.openness.org).
