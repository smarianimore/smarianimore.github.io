Hello ladies and gentlemen, I'm quite excited to announce my new publication as the co-authors lineup has a very special person...Prof. [Cristiano Castelfranchi](https://www.istc.cnr.it/en/people/cristiano-castelfranchi)! 
When I was younger his work on [Behavioural Implicit Communication](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/40773254/IVREA-ultimo-libre.pdf?1450206211=&response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DFrom_Conversation_to_Interaction_Via_Beh.pdf&Expires=1714944732&Signature=Rd9Lvo5ycpIgbMPkYvAn7loSiWuytR4GjFQjGhjXe0-zcEKT3vaHO2XCLXidfAHc4FlyFEgx7V76b~2e6Oxz5HaQQQyjER7TXabE1XIRX-5Pu8r~rqKJgC3rXhau63VeQT8W4~mSzXtDU0z-PD~9~Pr1ELLDKHO-kT5MbiUDim2AeoznVl3iIsXqsule6kEccGrWiEUM0c7LyvvVJo8zEABfCFrsjKEoBtAsmtRoiZH2bhsKfm7QdR4ugq1JVAsmeVH9JdnOWTHzx10eZ9H2uBxNfIhVR5iUyKqhlxNcGhA-J7BCocw-zsVMlMRyah1l1D0L-0gFq9QCBfrRtXJW4w__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA) struck me like a lightning and definitely inspired my work on the coordination model called [Molecules of Knowledge](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24309-2_8), as well as strongly pushed me to pursue my current career. 
Back then, I could only dream about co-writing a paper, and now here we are :)

The rest of the co-authors lineup also is packed with mentors to look at as sources of inspiration for me: Prof. [Franco Zambonelli](http://www.agentgroup.unimore.it/Zambonelli/) and Prof. [Alessandro Ricci](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/a.ricci/), two unlimited sources of original ideas and invaluable discussions!
Dott. [Samuele Burattini](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/samuele.burattini/) completes the lineup: a very promising young researcher to definitely keep an eye on for his already mature expertise on software agents, digital twins, semantic web technologies, and much more.

Enough with the "fangirling" now though, [back to the paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3635637.3663262):

We are closely following what is happening in the whole computer science field with **generative technologies** such as ChatGPT and large language models in generals, and draw attention to *a dangerous derivative of reductionism* that could affect software engineering in general, but especially agent-oriented software engineering: **eliminativism**. 
I think that the following excerpt explains better than anything our motivations for writing this contribution:

In the rest of the paper, we propose a **Cognitive Hourglass** to tame the complexity of engineering applications on top of generative and agent technologies, by adopting [human compatible]() abstractions. 
Take a look at the paper and **reach out to us if you wanna comment**: we are especially interested in *involving LLM experts in this discussion!*

[Mail me](mailto:stefano.mariani@unimore.it) in case, peace.
