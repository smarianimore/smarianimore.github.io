I'm happy to share the achievement of a brilliant graduate student, [Dario Ferrari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dario-ferrari-56abb4227/), that co-authored with me and [Franco Zambonelli](http://www.agentgroup.unimore.it/Zambonelli/) his very furst scientific publication at [PRIMA 2022]([http://www.idc2021.unirc.it](https://prima2022.webs.upv.es/accepted-papers/)) :)

**The warmest congratulations to Dario, bravo!**

In brief, the paper studies the application of *argumentation-based coordination* to an *intersection network* to improve global intersections management in throughput and delay.
The study is motivated by the fact that in a future of connected and self-driving vehicles, argumentation may prove effective in both providing *decentralised coordination* strategies, and in supporting *mixed scenarios* of human/self-driven vehicles, also favouring *explainability* of decisions taken by AI.

The key results achieved are:
  - **argumentation-based coordination** is effective in solving conflicts about vehicles' right of way
  - it can improve overall network **throughput**
  - it can also improve **cumulative delay**

The core idea of the approach is to envision vehicles enagging in computational argumentation when they approach an intersection, to try to resolve conflicts in their trajectories (if any).

Vehicles beliefs and facts about their situation are translated into an argumentation graph, which is then used to decide who to give the right of way to.
