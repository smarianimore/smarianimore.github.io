Are you **confused** about **Digital Twins** and their role in **AI**? 
Are they "reinventing the wheel" with a brand new name, or not? 
They seem to have a notable overlap with **Autonomous Agents** (the "software engineering" ones, not the modern LLM-like crap...), is it true? 

Well, if you are confused about the above, 
and in general about the role of these two abstractions and technologies (DTs and AAs) in modern AI, 
*WE GOT YOU COVERED :)*

In our latest paper, myself and some brilliant colleagues 
([Samuele Burattini](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/samuele.burattini/), [Sara Montagna](https://www.uniurb.it/persone/sara-montagna), [Marco Picone](https://www.marcopicone.net/), and [Alessandro Ricci](https://apice.unibo.it/xwiki/bin/view/AlessandroRicci/)) 
share our perspective on the matter, 
shedding light (hopefully ðŸ˜…) on the **complementary and synergistic role that DT and AA play** in modern AI-powered systems and applications. 

In brief, we propose **three software engineering principles** 
  (specificity, scoping, and timing)
to balance responsibilities between DTs and AAs in delivering intelligent functionalities, 
and a related set of "micro-architectures" resulting from the application of such principles. 
Both are aimed at assisting system designers to maximise modularity and re-usability of their "intelligent" components, 
and provide the most appropriate set of abstractions to engineer them.

Peace.
