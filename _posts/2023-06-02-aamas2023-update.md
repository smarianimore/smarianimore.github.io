Quick update on previous post about our AAMAS 2023 paper on causal discovery in MAS: the pdf is available at [IFAAMAS proceedings page](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/~eg/AAMAS2023/pdfs/p2807.pdf) :)

Also, an **extended version** has been accepted at [PAAMS 2023](https://www.paams.net/), hence stay tuned for further updates :)

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:stefano.mariani@unimore.it) for a pre-print or any further inquiry.

Peace.
