Quick post to share another joint work with a brilliant master student, [Pasquale Roseti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pasquale-roseti-a5b513238/), that co-authored with me and [Franco Zambonelli](http://www.agentgroup.unimore.it/Zambonelli/) his very furst scientific publication at [AAMAS 2023](https://aamas2023.soton.ac.uk/program/accepted-papers/#main-track-extended-abstracts) :)

**The warmest congratulations to Pasquale, bravo!**

In brief, the paper proposes a *multi-agent protocol* to collaboratively **discover (= learn) the causal structure** relating variables of interest (e.g. sensors and actuators) in a distributed network.
The study is motivated by the fact that learning not only *correlations* amomngst variables (as classical statistical ML does) but actual causal relations (as per level 2 of [Pearl's ladder of causation]()) is crucial to let agents proficiently understand situations and plan accordingly how to achieve their goals in unknown environments, also favouring *explainability* of decisions taken by AI.

The key results achieved are:
  - learning **accuracy is always better** with multi-agent learning than with single-agent learning
  - learning **performance is always better** in the multi-agent case, too, to an extent increasing as the causal network size and complexity increases (e.g. number of edges and indirect causal paths length)

The core idea of the approach is to leverage any existing causal discovery algorithm locally to each agent, that refine the locally learnt model by **coordinating interventions** with other agents sharing the environment, even when no overlap exists amongst the set of known variables.

The paper has been accepted as an extended abstract, hence stay tuned for an updated of a full paper version coming soon :)
